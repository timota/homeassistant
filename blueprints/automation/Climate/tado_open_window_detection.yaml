    # Tado open window detection

    **Version: 1.1.1**


    Tado Open Window Detection uses sensors to detect open windows or doors and temporarily turns off heating or cooling to save energy.


    <details>
    <summary><b>Summary:</b> ðŸ‘ˆ</summary>

      - Climate devices, such as heating, turn off when a window is opened and revert to their previous state once the window is closed. 
        
      - You can set a delay before the climate device returns to its previous state.

      - The supported HVAC modes are: auto, heat, and off.

      - For this automation to function, a mandatory text helper is required to store the current climate state, including mode and target temperature.
